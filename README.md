# Pomodoro Timer üçÖ

The Pomodoro Timer is a simple time management tool that helps you stay focused and productive. 
It is designed to break your work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. 
This technique is known as the Pomodoro Technique.


I have made this project to learn JS by building applications.
